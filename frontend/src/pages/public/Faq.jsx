                    <h3>Can I change or cancel my order once it has been placed?</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately, no. Once your order has been placed, it is sent to our warehouse for processing immediately to ensure quick delivery. If you need to return an item, please refer to our Return &amp; Exchange policy.</p>
